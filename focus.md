# Foucus Group

## Group 1
Group of students. 
Good overall feedback.
They could explore and understand most features autonomously.
Legibility of the interface is good.
They think it could be useful in a DSP class, after explaining the mathematics of the Z-transform.
 - The auto-gain feature is not very intuitive. But, once understood, it became their only way for adjusting the volume
 - The frequency text-box column should have a "Hz" label
 - Shortcuts are not really that useful
 - When asked, they answered that increasing the maximum order would be better

## Group 2
Group of professors.
Good overall feedback.
They could explore and understand most features autonomously.
Legibility of the interface is good.
They think it could be useful in a DSP class.
 - The zeros should be placeable outside the unit circle
 - Elements on the real axis should be of order 1
