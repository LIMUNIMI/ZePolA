ZePolA is a parameteric equalizer that can be operated by specifying the positions of poles and zeros on the Gaussian plane. You can experiment with your own filter by either:
 - specifying the numeric values of the parameters of the filter elements
 - interacting with the filter element representations in the Gaussian plane
 - designing a classical filter via the filter designer

## Parameter panel
- **Radius** Element distance from the origin in the Gaussian Plane
- **Angle** Element angle in the Gaussian plane (normalized between 0 and 1)
- **Hz** Element angle as a frequency in hertz
- **Type** Element type (zero or pole)
- **Active** Turns the element on/off
- **Gain** Input gain in decibel
- **Out** Moves zeros outside the unit circle (the magnitude is the inverse of the radius parameter)
- **1x** First-order filter element (real axis only)

### Gaussian Plane
Interact with the circles (zeros) and crosses (poles) on the plane to modify the element parameters
 - *Right-click* Activate/deactivate elements
 - *Drag* Adjust radius and angle
 - *Double-click* Swap between zero and pole
 - *Scroll* Adjust input gain

### Shortcuts
- **All On** Turn all elements on
- **All Off** Turn all elements off
- **Phases x2** Multiply all phase values by 2
- **Phases รท2** Divide all phase values by 2
- **Swap Ps/Zs** Swaps all zeros with poles and vice-versa

## Plots
The plots panel shows the filter's DTFT magnitude and phase
 - **LIN/DB** Toggle between linear amplitude or decibel
 - **LIN/LOG** Toggle between linear or logarithmic frequencies

## Filter Design
Parameters:
- **Type** Butterworth, Chebyshev Type-I, Chebyshev Type-II, or Elliptic
- **Shape** Low-pass, or High-pass
- **Order** Filter order (number of elements)
- **Cutoff frequency** Transition frequency between pass-band and stop-band
- **Passband ripple** Ripple amplitude in the passband, in decibel
- **Stopband ripple** Ripple amplitude in the stopband, in decibel

Buttons:
- **Update** Apply the settings to the filter elements
- **Auto** Automatically update on parameter change

## Top Menu
- **Undo** Revert changes
- **Redo** Restore changes
- **Reset** Restore default parameters
- **Save** Write parameters to an XML file
- **Load** Read parameters from an XML file
- **Export** Save filter coefficients to a CSV file
- **Man/Auto Gain** Toggles the auto-gain feature
